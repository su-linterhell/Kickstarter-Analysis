This chart shows the outcome of a theater campaign based on its launch date. There are a few trends we can see from this chart. Cancelled campaigns appear to remain relatively the same throughout the year/different dates. We see an increase in successful campaigns that were launched from March â€“ June, June being the month with the highest number of successful campaigns. After June, we see a continuous decline in successful campaigns, with December being the month with the least amount of successful campaigns.
